*	Python is a general-purpose interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, and high-level programming language. 
*	It was created by Guido van Rossum during 1985- 1990.

Interpreted:
*	Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not need to compile your program before executing it. This is similar to PERL and PHP
*	case sensitive

History of Python

*	developed by Guido van Rossum in the late eighties and early nineties at the National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in the Netherlands
*	derived from many other languages, including ABC, Modula-3, C, C++, Algol-68, SmallTalk, and Unix shell and other scripting languages.

*	Class names start with an uppercase letter. All other identifiers start with a lowercase letter.
*	Starting an identifier with a single leading underscore indicates that the identifier is private.
*	Starting an identifier with two leading underscores indicates a strongly private identifier.
*	If the identifier also ends with two trailing underscores, the identifier is a language-defined special name
